      <h3>What leaks in practice?</h3>
      <p>We have tested some of our own services from attacker's perspective. We attacked ourselves from outside, without leaving a trace. Without using any privileged information or credentials we were able steal from ourselves the secret keys used for our X.509 certificates, user names and passwords, instant messages, emails and business critical documents and communication.</p>

      <h3>How to stop the leak?</h3>
      <p>As long as the vulnerable version of OpenSSL is in use it can be abused. <a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140407.txt">Fixed OpenSSL</a> has been released and now it has to be deployed. Operating system vendors and distribution, appliance vendors, independent software vendors have to adopt the fix and notify their users. Service providers and users have to install the fix as it becomes available for the operating systems, networked appliances and software they use.</p>
